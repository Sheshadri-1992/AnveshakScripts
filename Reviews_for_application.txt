Optimal path from path a to b, may not have any traffic lights or lightly loaded.
Detecting where the ambulance is is done by the tracking logic.
Will there be any issue if there is a GPS module added to the ambulance.
Response : The whole point here is to track, GPS will act as a source of data to track.
If we have a GPS we don't need anveshak.

Use case : Transferring money from one place to another
Picked ambulance for social cause.
Ambulances are not centrally controlled, each ambulance is controlled by separate hospitals.

Multiple ambulances are in the traffic junction.
We need no information from the camera.

WE show that anveshak takes less time than the non-anveshak setup.
Google map came with a update recently on the heat-intensity of traffic in the map.

Bangalore map : 89000 nodes, 242k edges. average street length of 81m. (There are 20000Km of roads, 15million people)
How many traffic lights
Size of roads. Pruned, highways.
all are bi-directional edges.
Ambulances are not right now allowed in one way, we are not considering that.
In fact, if ambulances would go fast and reach quickly if we follow anveshak shortest path than going against in one way.

Dividers are not covered.
U-turns are not considered.

Loading map vs rendering (will it load the whole bangalore map.)

Backend, kubernetes orchestrating both rigel and polaris. 
20 nodes of rigel. Each edge device is a camera. (needs more than half a core)
Targetting at least 5000 camera max 10000 camera.

Put cameras on higher degree nodes.

10K containers on Rigel. 500 per node. (Right now tried 100 containers with 64MB , 55 to 60)
Frame size that we were using 168kb.

Above 400 conrainers, network issues spring up. (Check for all to all ping)
Multiple hour test on a weekly basis.

MQTT, messages can be lost.

Major questions to expect:
* why not GPS?
* Identical Ambulances.
